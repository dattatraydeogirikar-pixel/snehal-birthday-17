  <h1>Snehal 💖</h1>

  <p><strong>Snehal,</strong></p>
  <p>Today is not just any day… it’s the day you turn 17, the day the world was blessed with <em>you</em>. I feel so lucky that I’ve known you since 6th standard — all the laughter, all the small moments, all the memories we’ve created together… I wouldn’t trade any of them for anything.</p>

  <p>I still remember that day in <strong>10th grade</strong>, your birthday, when I first held your hand on the bus while returning home. That tiny moment felt like the world had paused for <strong>uss</strong>, and it’s etched in my heart forever. And the <strong>first hug on 16th September 2024</strong>… I’ll never forget how perfect that felt. Each of these moments made me realize how truly special you are.</p>

  <p>Since <strong>25th February 2024</strong>, we’ve been creating countless memories together — laughter, silly jokes, quiet talks, teasing each other, sharing dreams, and supporting one another. My <strong class="nick">sakhi</strong>, you’ve been my constant companion, my comfort, and the person who understands me like no one else. <strong>Uss</strong> journey with you has been the most beautiful adventure.</p>

  <p>My <strong class="nick">rasmalai</strong>, every time I see your smile, it feels like sunlight breaking through the clouds. You light up every space you’re in, and every moment with you becomes a memory I want to hold forever. I love how naturally we can laugh together, how we can be goofy, serious, and romantic all at once.</p>

  <p>My <strong class="nick">ladoo</strong>, your kindness, patience, and strength inspire me every day. You have this magical ability to make the world feel soft and safe, and I hope you always remember to treat yourself with the same love and care that you give to everyone else.</p>

  <p>My <strong class="nick">dudu</strong>, being with you has taught me so much about love, friendship, and trust. You are my partner in every sense — the one who stands by me, who celebrates my highs and comforts me during lows, who makes ordinary days extraordinary.</p>

  <p>And my <strong class="nick">raanisaheb</strong>, you are my queen in every little way — ruling my heart completely. Every memory we’ve made, every moment we’ve shared, and every laugh, hug, and hand-hold is engraved in my soul. I feel so blessed to have you as my girlfriend, my best friend, my soulmate — my everything.</p>

  <p>Snehal, 17 is a beautiful age. It’s a time to dream bigger, laugh louder, love deeper, and embrace every part of yourself. I hope you never forget your worth, your strength, and your beauty — not just outside, but inside, where your soul shines brighter than anyone I’ve ever known.</p>

  <p>Today, I want to remind you to <strong>take care of yourself</strong>, to cherish your happiness, and to know that I, <strong>Aashay</strong>, am always here — not just as your boyfriend, but as your friend, your partner, your soul. Every day with you is a gift, and I can’t wait for all the memories <strong>uss</strong> have yet to create.</p>

  <p>Happy 17th Birthday, my love. 💖</p>

  <p>With all my heart,<br><strong>Aashay</strong></p>
